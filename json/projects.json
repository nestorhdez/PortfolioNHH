The goal was to make a web with the aim of manage curriculums of people and companies. <br> The tasks I did were the following: <br><br> Both, in the profiles and companies pages, I made the request to the API and considering the asynchrony I had to render cards with certain information. Then, depending where do you click you can open a modal with all the information of the profile, edit or delete it. <br><br> Another task was to made the logic to be able to search by filtering the profiles according to the filled inputs.<br><br>Finally, I had to make a landing page for potential interested companies. <br><br>  You can see the code made by me on Github: <br> <span class=\"section-subtitle\"><a target:\"_blank\" class=\"link-underline\" href=\"https://github.com/nestorhdez/CV-Web/blob/master/js/model.js\">/js/model.js<a/>, <a target:\"_blank\" class=\"link-underline\" href=\"https://github.com/nestorhdez/CV-Web/blob/master/js/features-model.js\">/js/features-model.js</a>, <a target:\"_blank\" class=\"link-underline\" href=\"https://github.com/nestorhdez/CV-Web/blob/master/js/render.js\">/js/render.js</a> and <a target:\"_blank\" class=\"link-underline\" href=\"https://github.com/nestorhdez/CV-Web/blob/master/js/companies.js\">/js/companies.js</a> (class Companies).</span>",

It consists of design a function that accepts purchase price as the first argument, payment as the second, and cash-in-drawer (2D array listing available currency) as the third. Then, the function should always return an object with a status key with the state of the cash register as the value and a change key with the change due as the value.",
