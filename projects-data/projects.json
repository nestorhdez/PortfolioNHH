This is the implementation of everything learned to date with javascript, plus a test to strengthen teamwork with techniques such as scrum. The task assigned to my group, was to make a web application for desktop users with the aim of connecting people looking for employment in the world of web development with companies of the same. <br> Most of the time I spent doing tasks with javascript, although I also had some layout with bootstrap and css. <br><br> At the beginning of the project, I did the tasks of js writing in ES5 with global functions. As I was progressing in the bootcamp, I restructured the code to make it object oriented until I finally did it with ES6 classes. You can see how they were structured in Github: <br> <span class=\"section-subtitle\">/js/model.js, /js/features-model.js, /js/render.js and /js/companies.js (class Companies).</span>",
